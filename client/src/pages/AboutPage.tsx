      <p className="text-lg">
        Iâ€™m <strong>Aslan Umarov</strong>, an aspiring frontend developer eager to gain real-world experience in the dev world.

      <p className="text-lg">
        My long-term goal is to become a DevOps engineer, but right now Iâ€™m diving deep into full-stack development. Iâ€™ve been coding since I was 14 â€” it started as a fun hobby, but now Iâ€™m going all in to see how far I can really go.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Iâ€™m currently learning the <strong>MERN stack</strong> â€” React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB â€” and also exploring penetration testing to build more secure applications.
