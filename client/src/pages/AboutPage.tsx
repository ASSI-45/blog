        opportunities to gian read real-world experience. Since first discovering programming at the the age
        of 14, what began as a hobby quickly grew into a true passion. Today i am fully committed to pushing
        my limits and seeing just how far i can go in this field.
        <br />
        My long-term goal is to become a DevOps engineer. To get there i am currenlty focused on mastering full-stack
        development, buidling a strong foundation with the <b>MERN</b> stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js)
        in parallel, i am studying penetration testing to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity and ensure
        i create more secure, resilient web applications.

        Driven by relentless hunger for growth and learning, I constantly seek out challenges to charpen my skills
        and expand my knowledge.
